MarioPhone
==========

This is just something I was playing around with - feel free to take a look but use at your own risk :) I offer no support or guarantees that things even still work :)

It uses SignalR and a mobile-friendly page to allow you to control a Super Mario game (in your browser) using your phone.

It currently uses MarioHtml5 as the game (https://github.com/robertkleffner/mariohtml5)
